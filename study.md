Why is MongoDB so popular?  Explain why popularity should not be the only factor

```md
Its populr becuase its easy to put together when you dont have time to actually map out how you want to structure your database. Popularity shouldnt be the only factor when choosing your technology because you should also look into what the downsides are and how difficult it would be to change technologies once built.
