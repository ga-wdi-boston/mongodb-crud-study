immediately, it's hard to extend the database, the database can't handle

```

## Popularity

Why is MongoDB so popular?  Explain why popularity should not be the only factor
when choosing a technology

```md
MongoDB is popular because of the ease of the setup process, it allows for
simple use of tables. However, because it can't handle duplicated data, for the
example of Diaspora, because they were trying to relate users to friends, etc.,
users and friends are the same thing, so the database collapsed. When choosing
technology we need to look at functionality; popularity is a factor when
choosing technology, but functionality is important as well.
