## Advantages of MongoDB

In your own words, what are some advantages of a NoSQL database?

```md
Very flexible.
vast quantities of data that can be non/semi/fully structured.
Iterates fast through the schema and can push code often.
```

## Disadvantages of MongoDB

In your own words, what are some disadvantages of a NoSQL database?

```md
Less mature (not as tested as other since it is fairly new), therefor:
not as safe
no advanced expertise
no programming knowledge
less support
```

## Popularity

Why is MongoDB so popular?  Explain why popularity should not be the only factor
when choosing a technology

```md
MongoDB seems to be popular simply because it scales and is great in speed.
Popularity should have nothing to do with choosing a technology. You should find a tehcnology that meets your requirements.
For example, if data needs to be secured and someone choose MongoDB because it is popular, they should slap themselves.
Only once you find a tehcnology that will do everything you need can you start looking at popularity, and even then, you should probably look for a mature technology first before popularity.
```
