The following are advantages for using MongoDB (a NoSQL database): (1) There is no schema.  Because of this, you can have as many fields as you would like and you can add the data to another document at any time.  (2) It is flexible.  If you do not know how you would like to organize your data at a given time, MongoDB is beneficial because changes can be made easily. (3) Time Efficiency.  A database can be put together and modified at a much faster rate than that of a SQL database
