Why is MongoDB so popular?  Explain why popularity should not be the only factor
when choosing a technology

```md
MongoDb is popular because of it's quick setup and fast processing. But it's downfall is it's lack of structured data. Basically, it seems like the only reason to use mongoDB is when you are short on time or when you need a quick startup. Otherwise, just stil to a relational database because even though it might take longer to set up, it's a lot better in the long run.
