## Advantages of MongoDB

In your own words, what are some advantages of a NoSQL database?

```md
- They're great if you have huge amounts of data
- They're faster at handling said data
- They're good if you know your database will be going through lots of changes
- or, more specifically if you think you might want to add data later without bothering with schemas
```

## Disadvantages of MongoDB

In your own words, what are some disadvantages of a NoSQL database?

```md
- They seem less secure than SQL databases
- They seem less organized
- Tbh they just seem sketchier in general because so may things have relationships...?
- Wouldn't it be harder to debug?
```

## Popularity

Why is MongoDB so popular?  Explain why popularity should not be the only factor
when choosing a technology

```md
- Because for apps to be popular, they need to reach tons of people and be super fast
- And for developers to make money, their apps need to be popular
- So developers opt for the technology that can hold more data and act faster
- Choosing a technology should be like choosing a car...
  - Don't get the flashiest thing without thinking because you might get scammed
  - Get the thing that works according to YOUR NEEDS
  - (Plus flashier things get in trouble more often)
  - And if you don't do your research, you may spend lots of time and money fixing the problems that came with it
    - (See Sarah Mei)
  - Think ahead, basically. Don't waste your time and money because of a widely used technology.
