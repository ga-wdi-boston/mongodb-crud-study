## Advantages of MongoDB

In your own words, what are some advantages of a NoSQL database?

```md
- Large volumes of rapidly changing structured, semi-structured, and
unstructured data
- Agile sprints, quick schema iteration, and frequent code pushes
- Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
- Geographically distributed scale-out architecture instead of expensive,
monolithic architecture
```

## Disadvantages of MongoDB

In your own words, what are some disadvantages of a NoSQL database?

```md
- Most NoSQL databases do not perform ACID transactions, a tried and true
technique for ensuring that data remains consistent across the entire database
as it is moved around.
- SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications,
as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of
the data.
- NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support
```

## Popularity

Why is MongoDB so popular?  Explain why popularity should not be the only factor
when choosing a technology

```md
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database because it is scalable and was promoted
by the developmen community.  This doesn't mean it is the best technology for
a project.  Popularity is often based on people wanting NEW or COOL alternatives
when the original options might be just as good or even better.
