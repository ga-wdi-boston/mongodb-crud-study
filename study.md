## Advantages of MongoDB

In your own words, what are some advantages of a NoSQL database?

## Disadvantages of MongoDB

In your own words, what are some disadvantages of a NoSQL database?

```

## Popularity

```md
<!--It is popular due to its speed, flexability. However since it is possible to lose a lot of data if something goes wrong, or doesn't write correctly it seems silly to use in a large number of situations.-->
```
